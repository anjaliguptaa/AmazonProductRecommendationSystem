# AmazonProductRecommendationSystem

DESCRIPTION-
In this modern world we are overloaded with data and this data provides us the useful information. But it's not possible for the user to extract the information which interest them from these data. In order to help the user to find out information about the product , recommedation systems where developed.
Recommeder system creates a similarity between the user and items and exploits the similarity between user/item to make recommendations.
Online E-commerce websites like Amazon, Filpkart uses different recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users. Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time. This type of filtering matches each of the user's purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user. In this project we are going to build recommendation model for the electronics products of Amazon.
Collaberative Filtering:- It is based on assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste. it is mainly of two types: a) User-User b) Item -Item
